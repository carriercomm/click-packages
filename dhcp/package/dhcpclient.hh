DHCPClient(etheraddress [, I<keywords>])

=s DHCP

The core of the DHCP Client. The state machine resides in this element.

=d 

DHCPClient has at least 2 outgoing ports. Port 0 is designated for all
broadcast packets. Port 1 is designated for all unicast packets. Invalid
packets are output on port 2, if it exists; otherwise they are dropped.

Keyword arguments are:

=over 8

=item IPADDR

The client's current IP address, if any.

=item LEASE_CALL

A write handler to be called when the client gets a new lease, or loses its
current lease.  The write handler is called with additional arguments
consisting of the new lease description (see the 'lease' handler below).

=back

=h addr read-only

Returns the client's current IP address.

=h server read-only

Returns the server's current IP address.

=h lease read/write

The read handler returns information about the currently active DHCP lease.
If a lease is active, the format is C<"true MYIP SRVIP START END">, where MYIP
is the client's current IP address, SRVIP is the server's current IP address,
and START and END are times in seconds.  If no lease is active, the format is
C<"false MYIP">, where MYIP is the client's most recently active IP address.

The write handler expects a string in the same format, and sets the current
lease accordingly.

=h release write-only

When written, releases the currently active DHCP lease, if any.
