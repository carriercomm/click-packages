Click SNMP elements
===================

This directory is an add-on package for the Click modular router,
http://www.read.cs.ucla.edu/click/.  A prerequisite for building and using
the SNMP package is building and installing a recent version of Click.  The
elements are documented; after "make install", try "man SNMPTrapSource".
For a documented example configuration, see conf/test-trap.click.
