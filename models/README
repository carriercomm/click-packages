This directory contains the 'models' addons to the Click modular router.
First make and install Click, then run './configure
--prefix=CLICKINSTALLPREFIX' in this directory, and finally make install.

The 'package' subdirectory defines a package, "models.uo", which Click will
load in when given the "require(models)" statement. Elements in the package
include CalculateTCPLossEvents. CalculateTCPLossEvents analyzes a trace
that has been separated into TCP flows (such as by AggregateIPFlows), finds
the loss events and other information, and generates an XML file. 

The 'tcpscape' Python script reads this XML file and shows a time-sequence
plot that's easy to navigate.

The 'scripts/lossxml.sh' script takes a tcpdump file as argument, and
generates an XML loss file in the same directory with the same basename, by
running a short Click configuration. Examples:

	scripts/lossxml.sh examples/sample.dump
	   # Will create a file examples/sample.xml.
	scripts/lossxml.sh --config examples/sample.dump
	   # Will write a Click script to standard output.

examples/sample.xml is the output of scripts/lossxml.sh on
examples/sample.dump.

Try the following two tcpscape invocations to see what information the XML
provides:

	./tcpscape examples/sample.dump
	./tcpscape examples/sample.xml
